### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Although the faq functionality is up and running, I still have to find a way to remove the active class from a question when the user clicks on a new question.
When all the answers are openend, the container grows, but the background image does not.

### Continued development

I have to develop my JS skills further.
Also, the absolute positioning of the different images remains a challenge.
